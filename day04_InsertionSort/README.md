# What is Insertion Sort?
It builds the sorted array one element at a time.
Left part → sorted
Right part → unsorted

Take one element from right
Insert it into the correct position on the left.

# Time & Space Complexity
Case	                Time
Best (already sorted)	O(n) 
Average	                O(n²)
Worst (reverse sorted)	O(n²)

Space: O(1)

# Why Insertion Sort is IMPORTANT
Very fast for nearly sorted arrays
Used internally in hybrid algorithms
Cleaner logic than Bubble Sort
